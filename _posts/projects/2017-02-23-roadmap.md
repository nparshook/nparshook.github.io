title: Roadmap to becoming a Software Engineer

This project has two purposes.

1. To layout in detail exactly what I want to spend my time learning and creating in the coming months.
2. To become more comfortable with LaTex.

There isn't much more to say on this project that wouldn't be a repeat of what is stated in the document itself.
Therefore if you are curious as to what I have planned you can download a pdf of the document by going to the github page linked at the top of this page.

Also please note that at this stage the document is still a very early draft that is missing significant portions of what will be in the final version.
