Tiny_KVS is a key value store that is designed to be as space efficient as possible. The main api of putting, getting and deleting does 
function. However If you were to try to actually use it you would run into issues with fragmentation of the store. The compression module
functions correctly but needs much more thorough testing. I have not done any kind of performance testing as of yet but I am sure it would
be fairly slow, again I am sacrificing any and all speed for minimizing the overhead of storing the key value pairs.

Like my other projects this is still very young and thus I have not gotten to documenting any of it yet.
