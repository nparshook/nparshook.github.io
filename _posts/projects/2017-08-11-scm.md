SCM is a client server application for managing the execution of computational jobs on a cluster of machines. Being a very young project
it is mostly feature incomplete when comes to managing jobs (i.e. nonexistent) however the underlying network infrastructure is 
functioning. Both the head manager and node manager use remote procedure calls for communication. This is handled by the pickle_rpc module.
The server is single threaded as I have designed communication to create a new connection per request as these requests do not take long
and so should not bog down the server. Like a couple of my other new projects there is currently no documentation, that will change soon.
Testing is done on a cluster of virtual machines that I have setup locally for myself.
