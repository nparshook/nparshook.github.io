Buildengine is a simple module for facilitating the creation of build systems. As this is a relatively new project I apologize for the nonexistent documentation. There are a few examples on how to setup some simple build systems [here](https://github.com/nparshook/buildengine/tree/master/examples). If you would like to view a more complicated example please look at [mf.py](https://github.com/nparshook/tiny_kvs/blob/master/mf.py) in my tiny_kvs project.
