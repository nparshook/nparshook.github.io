I'm a computer engineer, plain and simple

What does it mean to be a computer engineer? Well first being an engineer I put practicality first, and theory second. If an algorithm is ten percent faster but almost impossible to implement is it actually useful compared to the easier to implement algorithm? Maybe but until that ten percent is absolutely needed time is better spent elsewhere. I'll leave the theory heavy stuff to the computer scientists.

My interests lie heavily in computer architecture, software architecture, and massively parallel and distributed systems. Compilers and graphics are something of a hobby of mine and I am currently reading and thoroughly enjoying "Modern Compiler Design" by David Grune et al. I also will occasionally dabble in printed circuit board design. 

As far as software development goes, my languages of choice are C and Python. I also have years of experience in Java and have, on occasion, used C++, C#, x86, Javascript, HTML, OpenGL, CUDA, and worked on a few Android apps.

So what do I do when I'm not working on something in the world of technology? I enjoy reading biographies and science fiction. I have a small library of books on strength and conditioning that I study to help myself continually improve my physical performance and health. My powerlifting total from a few years ago is 1085 lbs and would be much higher today if I were to compete again. And lastly there might not be anything more enjoyable than watching or playing a game of baseball. To me it is the greatest sport that mankind has ever conceived of.
